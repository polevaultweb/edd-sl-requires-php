Set the minimum PHP version required for a premium WordPress plugin managed by Easy Digital Downloads and the Software Licensing addon.

== Description ==

This is a plugin built specifically for developers that use Easy Digital Downloads to sell premium WordPress plugins.

WordPress allows free plugins to set a Requires PHP header in readme.txt files, but this isn't possible for premium plugins. This plugin extends Easy Digital Downloads and the Software Licensing addon to add a new 'Minimum PHP Version Required' setting to the Download readme.txt metabox, where you can set the minimum PHP version for your plugin.

This will then be passed to your customers' WordPress sites via the EDD SL updater code, and then WordPress won't allow customers to update to the new plugin version unless they have the required PHP version.

== Installation ==

* Install the plugin like any other WP plugin.
* Edit a download and set the minimum PHP version in the Download readme.txt metabox.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
